Kuhler
======
## Version 1.0.0

Kuhler is a web-based toolset for web designers who are tired of trying to come up with a color scheme using color pickers or simlar tools.

In most cases a client will describe the look and feel of the site they hope to have designed for them with words like "elegant", "modern", or "cool", "vintage" etc. 
So why not start your search for the right colors by simply typing those words into a search field and get redirected to some colors which are known to fit the "feel" of what the client might want.

For example: A client says they want red in their site design. How are you to know which red they mean. Maybe THEY don't even know what red it is they mean...they just like red. However, as you speak with them they use words like vivid and energetic. That narrows it down somewhat. Instantly we see a more saturated red. If they'd said elegant, rich, and warm we picture a darker less saturated red, like a crimson.

So Kuhler is the mediator between words and colors. Once you've entered the words or phrases the client used you'll move through the process of narrowing down you're search with color wheels "tools" which are manipulated with onscreen controls to give you full control of the palette.
